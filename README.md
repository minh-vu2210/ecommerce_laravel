## Reflection

This was a 2 week long project. The project goal is to learn how to use Laravel 8 Framework along with how to use Laravel migration, seeder and routes  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication and Session. This lead me to spend a few days on a research on how to maintain the current session until the user logout or closed the browser

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Laravel 8, Bootstrap 5, and a small amount of  CSS.
